    /* PROBLEM STATEMENT 
       In this exercise you'll be writing code to print name badges for factory employees.

       Task 1: Print a badge for an employee
       Employees have an ID, name and department name. Employee badge labels are formatted as follows: "[id] - name - DEPARTMENT". Implement the Badge.print() method to return an employee's badge label.

       Task 2: Print a badge for a new employee
       Due to a quirk in the computer system, new employees occasionally don't yet have an ID when they start working at the factory. As badges are required, they will receive a temporary badge without the ID prefix. Modify the Badge.print() method to support new employees that don't yet have an ID.

       Task 3: Print a badge for the owner
       Even the factory's owner has to wear a badge at all times. However, an owner does not have a department. In this case, the label should print "OWNER" instead of the department name. Modify the Badge.print() method to print a label for the owner.
